# Student Registration using MEAN 

I created an app using HTML,CSS, Bootstrap, Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB Atlas. This app is like a student registration form, where you can do several things with student data. 

First, you can add new student data to the app. Let's say a new student joins your school, and you want to enter their information into the app, such as their name, address, and Phone number. You use the "Add new Student data" feature to do that.

Next, if you made a mistake while entering a student's information or if a student's details change, you can update their data. For example, if a student changes their address or phone number, you can use the "Update Students data" feature to modify their information in the app.

Lastly, if a student leaves the school or you no longer need their information in the app, you can delete their data using the "Delete Students data" feature. This removes their information from the app entirely.

So, with this app, you can add new students, update existing student information, and delete student data when needed.
